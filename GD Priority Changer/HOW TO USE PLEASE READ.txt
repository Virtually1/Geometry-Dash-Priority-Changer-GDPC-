Edit your batch file with your path to GD and /priority,also choose the Disk you have GD on, by adding your disk letter.

Like for example i have E: but you can have your letter of the disk ex D:

LETTER DISK:			//my letter disk was E
cd LETTER DISK:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Geometry Dash
start /priority geometrydash.exe

EXAMPLE

E:			
cd E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Geometry Dash
start /priority geometrydash.exe

IF YOU HAVE CRACKED VERSION THEN JUST EDIT THE PATH TO GD 

EXAMPLE 2 for cracked version

LETTER DISK:			
cd path
start /priority geometrydash.exe

/priority it can be one of these:

/high
/abovenormal
/normal
/belownormal
